# The Two Magnetic Fields
### The B-Field & H-Field

The term Magnetic Field has been strenuous to gain a solid understanding, given that the term alone can refer to one of two evidently different fields; known as the **B-Field** and **H-Field**. The confusion was exacerbated by the alternative, more specific labels for these fields; Magnetic Flux Density, and Magnetic Field for the **B-field** and Magnetic Field intensity, Magnetic Field Strength, Magnetic Field, and the Magnetizing Field for the **H-field**.

The Magnetic Field is a vector quantity and therefore will have a magnitude and a direction. The magnitude will be found as shown further in this text. Where the direction of the magnetic field can be found using the corresponding Right-Hand Rule, based off conventional current flow. 

### H-Field <a id="H-Field"></a>
- This field is the basic or driving force behind a magnetic field. 
- Measured in Amperes per meter $$A\over{m}$$
- Can be found with $$\vec{H} = \frac{I}{2\pi r}$$
- Most correct term is the Magnetic Field Strength

### B-Field <a id="B-Field"></a>
- This is mostly the field that is used in formulas
- Measured in tesla $$T$$
- The most correct term is Magnetic Field Density
- Found with: 
  + $$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi r}$$
  + $$\vec{B} = \frac{\Phi}{A}$$
