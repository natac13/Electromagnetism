#Charge

The charge is that of an proton or electron. These two particle differ immensely with regard to size and mass, however having equal and opposite charges. These charges were what came to be know as positive and negative charges. 

Fundamental rule for charge states that like charges repel where opposite charges attract each other. Therefore a positive will be attracted to a negative and will repel another positive charge.
