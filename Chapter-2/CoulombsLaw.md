#Coulombs Law

Charles-Augustin de Coulomb published in 1785 what is known as Coulomb's Law.

States that the magnitude of the electrostatic force $$F_e$$ between two charged particles $$q_1 q_2$$ is directly proportional \propto to Coulomb's Constant $$k_e$$ multiplied by both charged particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two particles $$r^2$$  


Expressed as in scalar form as: 
$$
|F| = k_e\frac{|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r^2}
$$ 
Where: 
- $$|F|$$ is the magnitude of the Electrostatic Force 
- $$k_3$$ is Coulomb's Constant
- $$q_1$$ is the charge of particle one
- $$q_2$$ is the charge of particle two
- $$r$$ is the distance between the particles
