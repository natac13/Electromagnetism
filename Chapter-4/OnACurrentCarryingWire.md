# On a Current Carrying Wire

Recall that Force $$\vec{F}$$ equals the charge of a particle $$Q$$ multiplied by the velocity

Recall Magnetic Force; $$\vec{F} = Q\cdot\vec{V} \times \vec{B}$$

Since $$\vec{V}$$ is merely distance over time is can be rewirtten as:  
$$\vec{V} = \frac{\vec{L}}{t}$$    
**OR**  
$$\vec{V} = \frac{\vec{L}}{t} = \frac{1}{t} \cdot \vec{L}$$

**Where:**  
$$\vec{L}$$ = vector length of wire traveled;  
$$t$$ = time it took;  


Therefore:  
$$\vec{F} = Q \cdot \frac{1}{t} \cdot \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$$   
$$\vec{F} = \frac{Q}{t} \cdot \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$$   
*Since:*  $$\frac{Q}{t}$$, coulombs over time, equal current, $$I$$  
$$\vec{F} = I \cdot \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$$  
**OR**  
$$|\vec{F}| = I \cdot |\vec{L}| \cdot |\vec{B}| \cdot \sin \Theta$$ 

#### Example 

A 1 tesla magnetic field, of a direction into the page, with a 2 meter length of wire, with a current flow of 5 amperes, left to right; what is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force acting on the current carrying wire?

$$F = ILB \cdot \sin \Theta$$  
$$= (5A)(2m)(1T) \cdot \sin 90\degree$$  
$$= 10N$$  
*N is newtons*  
**Therefore:**  
To find the direction of the magnetic force vector use the right hand rule; with the index finger in the direction of current flow; middle finger in the direction of the magnetic field; the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic force on the wire.  
*Index left to right, middle into the page and the thumb will point upwards*
