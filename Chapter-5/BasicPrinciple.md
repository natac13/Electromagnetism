# Basic Principle Behind Electric Motor Operation

The following example will be very similar to a D/C motor. However the underlying concept is what is causing all motors to rotate; the squirrel-cage and induction motors will be explained as well.

The reason for rotation is due to the current in the rotor circuit (whether armature or squirrel-cage windings) flowing in such a direction within a magnetic field, which leads to a magnetic force, which is responsible for the rotation of the rotor of the motor. Meaning it is not a attraction of magnetic poles as I initially thought. 

It is the magnetic force, the cross-product of the current flowing through a length of with in a magnetic field. $$\vec{F} = I \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$$

#### Explanation
**Using a D/C motor**  
A simplified version of a motor; one loop of wire to make up the armature, connected to two brushes that ride on a commutator. A commutator is made up of conducting segments which are attached to a D/C power source. Thus each brush will maintain its polarity, making current flow in one apparent direction regardless of what wire is in contact with the a brush. A magnetic field is said to be in the direction of North to South, therefore using the right-hand rule based off the cross-product $$\vec{F} = I \cdot \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$$ of the length of wire in conventional current flow (top wire is right to left, index finger), and the magnetic field vector (pointing down with the middle finger), leading to a magnetic force into the page on the bottom wire and out of the page on the top wire.   
As the wires will switch current flow due to alternating contact with commutator segments, the magnetic force exerted on the top and bottom sections of wire maintain its direction. This leads to the continual rotation of the rotor, procuring a motor.

**Using an A/C Motor**  
The same magnetic force on a current carrying wire is what is rotating an induction motor as well. Plus, in an induction motor the concept of magnetic force on a charged particle is evident. 

*The rotating magnetic field can be visualized in either way for explanation purposes*

First, using the magnetic force acting on a charged particle concept. At this moment in both pictures the rotating magnetic field (RMF) is moving clockwise, which yields the velocity vector direction of the conductors—which compose the rotor—rotate in a counter-clockwise direction (or right to left at the top and left to right at the bottom). Therefore a electromotive force($$emf$$) is induced into the squirrel-cage / amortisseur windings; being shorted at both ends a current is developed. The conductors at the top of the rotor in the diagrams have a velocity vector right to left (which is 'cutting' of lines of flux); the magnetic field is in the downward direction (recall North to South). This procures a current flow out of the page for the top windings, and into the page for the bottom windings.

Next, use the magnetic force on a current carrying wire concept. This will analysis will determine the direction of rotation for the rotor. Recall $$\vec{F} = I \cdot \left( \vec{L} \times \vec{B} \right)$$. Thus once agin using the right-hand rule determine the direction of the magnetic force; the index finger points in the direction of conventional current flow in the length of wire; the middle finger points in the direction of the magnetic field—downward; with the thumb being the resultant direction of the magnetic force—to the right. This is the concept which causes the squirrel-cage and amortisseur windings to rotate A/C motors.
