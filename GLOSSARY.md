## A/C
Alternating Current flow. Current with reverse direction periodically. [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current)

## Charge
The positive or negative—arbitrary—labels given to a particle, either proton or electron respectively. Like charges will repel and opposite charges will attract each other.

## Conventional Current Flow
Created before electrons were discovered, this states that current will flow out of the positive terminal and flow to the negative terminal of the power source. 

## coulomb
This is the unit of electric charge. Symbol is $$Q$$ or $$q$$. Thus is the charged moved by a one ampere current in one second. $$1C = 1A \cdot 1s$$

$$1C \approx 6.24 \times 10^18 e$$ or One coulomb approximately equals six point two four time 10 to the 18 $$e$$, where $$e$$ is the charge of one proton. Could also be negative for an electron.

## Coulomb's Constant
Also known as the electric force constant, or the electrostatic constant. The value is represented with the term $$k_e$$. Where the constant itself is equal to $$k_e = 8.987 551 787 368 176 4 \times 10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$$ or for practical means $$k_e = 8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$$.

## D/C
Direct Current flow. Current will flow in only one direction. It can vary in magnitude. Will have a positive and negative polarity. Some sources include: solar panels and batteries. [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current)

## Lorentz Force Law
$$\vec{F} = Q(\vec{E} + \vec{V} \times \vec{B})$$

**Where:**  
$$\vec{F}$$ is the Electromagnetic Force vector  
$$Q$$ is the Charged of the particle  
$$\vec{E}$$ is the Electric Force vector  
$$\vec{V}$$ is the velocity vector of the charged particle  
$$\vec{B}$$ is the Magnetic Field  

## Magnetic Force
#### On a Charged Particle  
$$\vec{F} = Q \cdot \left( \vec{V} \times \vec{B} \right)$$  
$$|F| = Q \cdot |V| \cdot |B| \cdot \sin \Theta$$

**Where:**  
$$\vec{F}$$ is the Electromagnetic Force vector on the charged particle;  
$$Q$$ is the Charged of the particle;  
$$\vec{V}$$ is the velocity vector of the charged particle;  
$$\vec{B}$$ is the Magnetic Field;  
$$\Theta \lt 180\degree$$ the angle between the velocity and magnetic field vectors.  

#### On a Current Carrying Wire  
$$\vec{F} = I \cdot \left( \vec{L} \times \vec{B} \right)$$  
$$|F| = I \cdot |L| \cdot |B| \cdot \sin \Theta$$

**Where:**  
$$\vec{F}$$ is the Electromagnetic Force vector on the current carrying wire;  
$$I$$ is the Current Flow in the Wire;  
$$\vec{L}$$ is the length vector of the current carrying wire;  
$$\vec{B}$$ is the Magnetic Field;  
$$\Theta \lt 180\degree$$ the angle between the length and magnetic field vectors.  

Applied with the right hand rule. Place the index finger in the direction of the first vector (whether $$\vec{V}$$ or $$\vec{L}$$); the middle finger in the direction of the second vector in the equation—$$\vec{B}$$; with your thumb pointing in the direction of the magnetic force. 

## Right-hand Rule
Applied to vector cross-products. Point the index finger in the direction of the first vector and the middle finger in the direction of the second vector of the cross-product. The thumb will be the resultant vector which is perpendicular to both of the vector composing the cross-product.
