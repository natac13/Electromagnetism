# Introduction

This book is a working knowledge of my understanding of Electromagnetism. 

### Who am I?
I am an Electrical Apprentice learning the underlining principles behind the electrical theory received through my three levels at trade school. As the apprenticeship program is a basic knowledge course, I struggled with a lack of deeper understanding. However the level of competence which I desire is located in between the practical level of Apprentices and the advanced mathematical design level of Electrical Engineers. 

Simply I felt there were gaps in my knowledge and I an seeking to fill in the holes.
